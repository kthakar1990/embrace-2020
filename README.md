## Short description

### What's the problem?

People in the Black Community are faced with harsher downstream effects (charged at higher rates, assigned more significant charges, convicted at higher rates, given longer sentences, and denied parole more often) than people of other races for similar offenses.

### How can technology help?

TBD

### The idea

There is a growing need in mitigating bias against specific communities in sentencing process. This solution is primarily to bring in the exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to build a rational sentencing model which supplements the Judiciary System officials to evaluate unbiased sentencing criteria. This solution also trying to build an improved Decisive model which eradicates some of the inaccuracies in existing models.

## The architecture

The overall solution is built using an Angular-based frontend which the judge or municipal employee can use to fill in their sentencing information. This frontend makes a request to a Python-based microservice built on Flask. The microservice is a simple shim to facilitate calling the model through an HTTP API request.


## Long description

People in Black Communities are faced with harsher downstream effects than people of other races for similar offenses. Our project attempts to analyze a given offense and the preliminary sentencing determination given by a judge to determine if that sentence falls in line with expectations where race is not a factor.

We used data made available from Cook County, IL (Chicago and surrounding municipalities) to build a model of sentencing based on a variety of factors including charges convicted, category of offenses, age, race, gender, etc. We specifically include race as a feature of the model so that we can compare outcomes based on race. By comparing the sentencing data between a hypothetical Black and White offender, we can determine within some probability that this sentencing is biased or not.
